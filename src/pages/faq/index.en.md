      Hedvig currently only offers apartment insurance - both for rental
      apartments and owned apartments. This insurance also include travel
      insurance for trips up to 45 days as well as insurance for all your
      gadgets and items - as long as they cost less than 50 000sek.
    question: What type of insurance does Hedvig offer?
  - answer: >-
      No problem. Hedvig takes care of the switch for you. Simply sign up with
      your Mobile Bank ID and we will activate your Hedvig insurance when your
      existing insurance expires. You're never without insurance and don't have
      to worry about terminating your existing policy.
    question: 'I want to switch to Hedvig but already have insurance, how can I change? '
  - answer: >-
      Hedvig is Sweden's only insurance without a fixed contract length. We
      think you should have the freedom to pick and switch insurances as you
      like so that means you can cancel at any time.
    question: How long is the contract for?
  - answer: >-
      Absolutely. Hedvig is reinsured by International Insurance Company of
      Hannover. One of the largest insurance companies in the world. You can't
      get much safer than that.
    question: Is Hedvig safe?
  - answer: >-
      Some years there might be fewer claims which means there's money left
      over. Traditional insurance companies normally take that money themselves
      as profit. But Hedvig is different. If there is money left over we donate
      it to charities - you get decide which ones!
    question: How does Hedvig work with charities?
  - answer: >-
      No, Hedvig is a for-profit company. We take a fixed 20%  from your monthly
      payment and that's it. This allows us to focus on providing the best
      service possible to you and not on making more money from denying claims.
    question: Is Hedvig a non-profit?
